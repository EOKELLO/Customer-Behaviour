# Customer-Behaviour
This is the first project attempted in R. I welcome contributions to improve the work.

This dataset helps us to understand the customer data given the marketing and sales data.

The nature of the data given can be said to be Behaviourial data.From the data we want to establish:

1.where to improve Focus if possible
2.what regions to increase Competitiveness
3.Increased Customer Retention
4.Capitalize When The Time is Right and month
5.Revenue
We intend to achieve this through extensive EDA and finally plot out on the customer segmentation.

we shall use R programming language to do the work.
